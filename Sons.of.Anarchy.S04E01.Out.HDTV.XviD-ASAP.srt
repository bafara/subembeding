It's gotta stay that way, huh?

170
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,723
You okay?

171
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,392
Yeah. Anxious.

172
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,528
Mmm. I'm proud of you.

173
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,900
Ain't easy making things
work when they're inside.

174
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,066
You done great.

175
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,735
I couldn't have
done it without you.

176
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:34,070
Wasn't just me.

177
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,539
Was the whole club.

178
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,642
Yeah, it's true.

179
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:42,311
I love you.

180
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,546
Me, too.

181
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,482
Daddy's home.

182
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,519
Hey, you're here!

183
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:51,520
Whoo, yeah!

184
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:16,710
Say hi to Daddy.

185
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:19,413
Yeah!

186
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,747
How you doing?

187
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:21,848
All right?

188
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:22,921
Oh, someone's happy.

189
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,789
Hi, baby.

190
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:30,900
Oh, I'm so
glad you're home.

191
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:33,361
I love you.

192
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:35,090
I love you, too, Mom.

193
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,768
She did good.

194
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:42,602
Yeah, I know.

195
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,671
She did great.

196
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,239
Hey.

197
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:49,242
I picked out the one you wanted.

198
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,713
Where's Wayne?

199
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:55,881
I don't know.

200
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,984
He said he'd be here.

201
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:58,985
Really good to have

202
00:10:59,053 --> 00:10:59,986
you back, Clay.

203
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,354
Holy shit, Chucky.

204
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:03,690
You got digits.

205
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,492
You grow those?

206
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,057
- It was Gemma.
- Gemma?

207
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,600
Yeah, I bought
him fingers.

208
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,364
Those shitty little nubs were

209
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,366
freakin' me out.

210
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,146
Were you freaking
her out?

211
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:14,236
Were you freaking her out?

212
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:15,237
Freaking her out!

213
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,479
Chapel ten minutes.

214
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:29,752
Yeah?

215
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,221
Sherriff Roosevelt.

216
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,756
I'm Linc Potter.

217
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:36,792
Assistant U.S. Attorney.

218
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,460
I, uh...

219
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,563
I have a, uh, card here

220
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:41,930
somewhere.

221
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,799
Ah.

222
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:47,870
It's uh...

223
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,872
There you are.

224
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,776
It's nice to meet you.

225
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:54,777
Same here.

226
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:55,544
All right.

227
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:56,479
We're renting some

228
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:57,680
space here, up on
the third floor.

229
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:59,316
Yeah, I've seen you
guys coming and going.

230
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,252
So, what can I do for you?

231
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,453
Well, uh, I was

232
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:05,845
hoping maybe you could
stop by later.

233
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,792
Want to bounce a few
things off of you.

234
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,560
Okay.

235
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,229
Officially?

236
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,230
Yes.

237
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,899
I talked to Sheriff Moore.

238
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,435
You're clear to join us.

239
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,737
Okay.

240
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,900
Mayor Hale.
Lincoln Potter

241
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,876
I've heard a lot of great
things about you, sir.

242
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,914
You're the AUSA.

243
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:31,915
That's right.

244
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,314
Well, uh, Sheriff, I
will see you later.

245
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,694
It was so nice to meet you.

246
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,696
Likewise.

247
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,536
What's that about?

248
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,700
Oh, probably just protocol.

249
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,674
You know, those guys been

250
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:56,342
setting up shop upstairs, in the

251
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:58,177
last two months.

252
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:00,246
How'd it go this
morning?

253
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:01,380
Without incident.

254
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:02,450
Clay and his boys got
the message.

255
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,023
I hope you don't
think one roadblock

256
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,200
is gonna get these
scumbags in line.

257
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,324
They've been quiet because
most of them have been inside.

258
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,395
- I'm on top of it.
- Oh, I know.

259
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,902
That's why I brought
the sheriffs here.

260
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,969
We need your kind
of law enforcement.

261
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,738
And that's what you're
gonna get, Jacob.

262
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,371
I've dealt with gangs for
the last 15 years, so...

263
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,865
Neutralizing their power's just

264
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,734
not going to happen in a day.

265
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,235
Of course not.

266
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,403
You and I both know there

267
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,705
are a lot of important things to

268
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,073
accomplish here in Charming.

269
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,408
I'm just trying to keep everyone

270
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,977
focused on those goals.

271
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,111
Yeah, I understand.

272
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,713
I understand.

273
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:36,250
And I appreciate that.

274
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:39,651
You let me know if you
need anything.

275
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,966
Thank you.

276
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,435
Your combat pay,
gentlemen.

277
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,894
I knew that two years

278
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,500
of community college
would pay off.

279
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,496
Even at a small
percentage

280
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,000
the new guns are pretty sweet.

281
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,667
Mayans, Italians, Niners,

282
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,795
everybody loves 'em.

283
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,100
The small percentages are over.

284
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,508
Piney, Ope...

285
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,877
Chibs, Kozik.

286
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,113
You did an outstanding job

287
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,882
holding us together, making

288
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,351
this new business work.

289
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:12,900
You did all the hard
work, brother.

290
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,800
We just grunted out the
day to day.

291
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:16,356
Well, you got my

292
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:17,357
deepest appreciation.

293
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:18,358
Absolutely.

294
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,727
Yes. Yeah.

295
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:21,762
Thanks, Ope.

296
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,363
You too, Chibby.

297
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:25,199
So, you know anything

298
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:26,133
new with our mayor's little

299
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:28,069
McMansion utopia?

300
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,230
Rich yuppies are
fleeing Stockton.

301
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:32,494
The city's a war zone.
We're hearing that Hale's

302
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:34,108
got a shitload of presales, and

303
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,343
just needs a few more investors

304
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:36,500
before he starts
swinging hammers.

305
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:38,580
This, um, Oswald

306
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,315
Construction bid, what is that?

307
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:41,817
Is that some sort of consolation

308
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:43,252
prize from Hale?

309
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,286
And when Hale pushed

310
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:45,855
that 99 on-ramp through the

311
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:46,822
City Council, all that

312
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,891
timberland went eminent domain,

313
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,700
and Elliot, you know,
lost millions.

314
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,629
So Hale, he's letting him make

315
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:54,798
it up with lumber and labor.

316
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:56,646
Yeah, Charming's
pretty much embraced it, Clay.

317
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,852
I mean, it'll provide
construction jobs,

318
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,220
doubles the output
at the mill...

319
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:01,900
Short term.

320
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,641
Hale's building homes in this

321
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,162
town that no one in
this town can afford.

322
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:09,756
Anybody else see a
problem with that?

323
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,448
I mean, Jacob Hale's been laying

324
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,543
this track for more than
five years now.

325
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:18,348
City councils, zoning
committees,

326
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,566
getting rid of Charming P.D.

327
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:26,528
No.

328
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,529
We're not gonna let this happen.

329
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:37,357
The black and proud
Sheriff Roosevelt.

330
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,007
Who the hell is he?

331
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:39,875
We don't know much.

332
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:41,877
He's out of a gangland task

333
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:43,045
force from Oakland.

334
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:44,550
He's been working ten months.

335
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,250
He's let us know he's 
here, but this is

336
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,300
the first time he's
whipped his dick out.

337
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,800
Yeah, he's been
pretty low-key.

338
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,155
Yeah, not anymore.

339
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,100
Yeah, I guess today
was about letting us know

340
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,241
it ain't gonna be
business as usual.

341
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,932
Yeah. We're gonna
have to dig pretty

342
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,495
deep into this guy.

343
00:15:57,564 --> 00:15:58,496
You're not gonna get

344
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,131
this sheriff on your payroll.

345
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,567
This boy's a straight-up cop.

346
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:03,367
All right.

347
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,600
The meet is set with Putlova.

348
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,062
The Jellybean Lounge.

349
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:09,200
What is it with Russians
and strippers?

350
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,775
They ain't strippers.

351
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:12,409
You been to the Jellybean?

352
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:14,111
It's horse meat in a g-string.

353
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,550
I love the Jellybean, man.

354
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:16,981
Of course you do.

355
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,315
I love it, too.

356
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:20,089
And the freak circle
is complete.

357
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:22,853
Ope...

358
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,800
- Everything set?
- Yeah. The Wahewa's

359
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:27,150
are gonna let us use the
southwest reservation.

360
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,491
You exit off at 18 miler.

361
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,660
Be there at 6:00.

362
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,362
And I know how much money is in

363
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:34,097
those envelopes, so those

364
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,782
wedding gifts better
not be bullshit.

365
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,702
All right.

366
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,638
We all got our marching orders.

367
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:42,803
Hey.

368
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:46,375
It's a very big day.

369
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:49,779
So let's get it done.

370
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:55,752
Clay.

371
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:57,754
We got company outside.

372
00:16:57,823 --> 00:16:59,403
Two sheriffs, watching us
down the block.

373
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,826
Roosevelt.

374
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,300
He's probably going to tail.

375
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:05,929
Well, if he does,

376
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:07,530
he can't follow all of us.

377
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,698
I want, uh, Jax and

378
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:09,700
Opie with me.

379
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:11,457
Need the rest to
help get us there.

380
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,737
- Squiggy.
- Yeah.

381
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,137
I want you to drive

382
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,072
the tow-truck behind us.

383
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,072
Is that 'cause you're

384
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:17,073
upset with me?

385
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,374
We're on
parole, genius.

386
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,000
Can only congregate
if we're working.

387
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:22,981
I mean, come on, man.

388
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,549
I should be with you.

389
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,250
I'll be all right.

390
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,880
Need most of us
to stay detached.

391
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,256
We get the fun stuff.

392
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,258
Promise?

393
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:07,298
They're splitting up.

394
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:11,500
What do we do?

395
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,865
We stay with Clay.

396
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,353
What the hell is this?

397
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:42,057
They're boxing us in.

398
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,468
Goddamn it.

399
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:03,013
Clear the road.

400
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,949
Hey!

401
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:09,500
- Chibs!
- Whoa!

402
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,010
Son of a bitch.

403
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm gonna kill these
pale bitches.

404
00:19:57,425 --> 00:20:00,027
Why the confidentiality?

405
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,828
Peace of mind.

406
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,563
That way, you say anything

407
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:04,731
about what you see, I strip your

408
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,433
badge and throw you in jail.

409
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:09,535
I have some trust issues.

410
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:16,041
Please.

411
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,153
Some of these faces may
be familiar to you.

412
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:40,336
Jesus.

413
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:44,588
In 1970, Dick
Nixon signed into law the

414
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:45,976
Organized Crime Control Act.

415
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,077
Section 901 of that law...

416
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,279
Racketeer Influence and

417
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,615
Corrupt Organization Act.

418
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:55,600
Welcome to the war room.

419
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:59,053
Agents Lane, Kessler-- FBI.

420
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:00,655
Vance, ICE.

421
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,757
Woodrow, Grad, ATF.

422
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:06,126
Have a seat, Sheriff, please.

423
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:09,295
So you really think

424
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:10,463
you're gonna be able to

425
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,899
use RICO against the Sons?

426
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:15,243
The MC's become a
major distributer

427
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,704
for a group of Real IRA members,

428
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:20,141
modestly self-titled
the Irish Kings.

429
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:23,000
Struck a deal when they
were in Belfast last year.

430
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:26,500
Sons killed Jimmy O'Phelan;

431
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,044
IRA boss turned rat.

432
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,408
In return, the Irish
opened up their arsenal,

433
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:34,658
gave SAMCRO access to a
whole new caliber of weapons.

434
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,508
Pun intended.

435
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:42,000
So how do the Russians fit in?

436
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,397
The Russians were
providing a safe house for

437
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:47,366
O'Phelan in exchange for guns.

438
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:49,468
But they got a better offer

439
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:52,071
from the Sons.

440
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,740
Then Clay double-crossed

441
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,042
Putlova, took out Phelan,

442
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,644
left the Russians with zip.

443
00:21:57,713 --> 00:21:59,045
And that's why Jax

444
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:01,749
Teller got shived in Stockton--

445
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:04,152
Russians' retaliation.

446
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,453
And to make peace,

447
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:07,923
Clay made a distribution
deal with Putlova.

448
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,891
They got the lion's share of the

449
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,494
guns and profits while
the MC was inside.

450
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:14,220
And now that the Sons are out,

451
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,099
all of that will be changing.

452
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,769
Yes, and as to, uh...

453
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:23,605
how, we'll know how
soon enough.

454
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:28,895
You have someone on the inside.

455
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,166
FBI Agent Ronald Worski.

456
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,087
Been undercover with the
Russians for over a year now.

457
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,656
He's very close to becoming

458
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,858
Putlova's number two.

459
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,127
We've tracked the
distribution from Belfast

460
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:47,332
and Dungloe over to Canada and
down the West Coast to Mendocino.

461
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:52,871
AK-47s, KG-9s, FN-57s, AR-15s.

462
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,405
Jesus.

463
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,974
Once our agent is
inside the circle,

464
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,676
we'll be able to get tape on

465
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,112
Putlova buying and
selling illegal arms.

466
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,480
And in one broad stroke,

467
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,715
we will take down the ROC

468
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:11,546
and by association, the Real
IRA, and the Sons of Anarchy.

469
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,100
And of all this is going
in Sanwa.

470
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,705
It's the only reason why you
would want to bring me in.

471
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:25,753
Yeah, most likely, it
will happen in your backyard.

472
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,823
But that is not the only reason

473
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:32,692
we're talking.

474
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:33,827
I checked your file,

475
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:36,429
talked to your superiors.

476
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:37,463
You have years of street time

477
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:38,997
with the local gangs and

478
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:41,466
players in Northern Cali.

479
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:43,001
We don't.

480
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:46,037
You're not here by default, sir.

481
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:48,706
You're here because
you can be trusted...

482
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,910
And because we need you.

483
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:01,655
Count me in.

484
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:06,419
Let's get him up to speed.

485
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,674
Welcome, gentlemen.

486
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:27,314
I trust you are healing well?

487
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,348
Fine.

488
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,183
Just business, right?

489
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,451
Yes.

490
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,287
I'm glad we could
settle all that.

491
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:38,591
It's not all settled.

492
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,627
You've been, uh, taking 80%

493
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:44,163
of the Irish stock for your
customers up north.

494
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,499
And 80% of
the risk as well.

495
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,300
We handled all the
transport and storage.

496
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:53,405
Well, now it's time for that
equal share scenario to kick in.

497
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:57,877
Yes, as we discussed,
you'll get 50% of the hardware.

498
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:02,214
But if we continue to transport

499
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:05,586
and house the guns, we
need to be compensated.

500
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,389
It's gonna take us a
little while to set up shop.

501
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:10,223
We'll give you five percent.

502
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:12,325
That's an awful lot of risk
and manpower for

503
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:13,326
just five percent.

504
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:16,595
Hey, we know how much you're
making running these guns.

505
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:18,520
Don't play broken
peasant with us.

506
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,402
Fair enough.

507
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,500
Five percent for
the first month

508
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:27,280
and 15%, if you stay longer.

509
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,318
Deal.

510
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:42,056
Uh, we're gonna want to see the
new merch. Get familiar with it.

511
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:43,725
I wanted to
bring it here.

512
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:46,294
We got some local
eyes on us.

513
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:48,263
We're hoping we could
see 'em tonight.

514
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:50,031
Check out your operation.

515
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,900
I thought tonight
was a celebration.

516
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:55,336
Yeah, we thought it'd be
good cover to get away.

517
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:56,637
Mm. Of course.

518
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:58,872
I'll make sure my men are there.

519
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:00,173
Great.

520
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,242
So we'll see you at the party?

521
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,610
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

522
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,246
Well, here's to a long

523
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:10,748
and profitable relationship.

524
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,751
<i>Na Zdorovie.</i>

525
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:47,551
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

526
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:49,158
<i>I heard you!</i>

527
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,655
You're gonna take it off
the goddamn hinges!

528
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,125
Sorry. I thought you
might have

529
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:55,593
upped and died on me in there.

530
00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:58,102
Well, if I did, knocking
louder ain't gonna help.

531
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:06,239
Jesus, Wayne.

532
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:09,800
You told me you were gonna
hire somebody to help you out.

533
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:12,050
I don't need nobody
nosing around my shit.

534
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,468
Besides...

535
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:18,652
if you'd have called...

536
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,921
I might have had a chance
to clean up a little bit.

537
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,892
Your phone's been disconnected.

538
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:29,228
Oh.

539
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:31,364
Sit.

540
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,246
- What?
- Sit down.

541
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,375
Clay came home today.

542
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,277
You were supposed to come by.

543
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:45,481
Jesus Christ.

544
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:48,551
Was that today?

545
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,685
God...

546
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:54,156
I'm sorry, I... I just, uh..

547
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:56,325
I kinda lost track of time.

548
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:00,730
How are the new meds?

549
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,431
I don't know.

550
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:03,032
I quit taking 'em.

551
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:05,668
Wayne...

552
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:06,870
I can't afford 'em.

553
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:09,038
Coverage is shit.

554
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:11,908
I mean, all they do is make me

555
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:14,411
puke and sleep.

556
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:28,593
What's going on with you?

557
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:31,129
Just, uh...

558
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:33,231
living the dream.

559
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:44,707
Does, uh, Clay know about me
and Della splitting up?

560
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:46,642
Yeah.

561
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:50,546
I don't think he's privy to

562
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:54,684
your new rock star
lifestyle, however.

563
00:28:54,753 --> 00:28:56,686
Right.

564
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,264
Noticed your plants

565
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,367
weren't doing so well out there.

566
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:14,639
Yeah...

567
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:19,844
Everything is just...

568
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:22,314
kinda dying on me.

569
00:29:25,453 --> 00:29:27,320
Oh, shit.

570
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:29,321
I know, sweetheart.

571
00:29:30,724 --> 00:29:31,657
Shit.

572
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:34,659
I know.

573
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:39,346
Dispatch, this is

574
00:29:39,415 --> 00:29:41,415
SJ-19 for substation Morada.

575
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:43,417
Bobby, getting anything for Ope?

576
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:45,585
I was gonna give him cash.

577
00:29:45,654 --> 00:29:48,456
How much you giving 'em?

578
00:29:48,457 --> 00:29:49,589
A lot more than you,

579
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:50,490
you cheap-ass bastard.

580
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,625
I'm not cheap, just

581
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:54,293
mindful of excessive spending.

582
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:56,428
Dude, you re-use comdoms.

583
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:59,498
How about you, Juicy?

584
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:00,766
Giving them both ten

585
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:02,734
sessions at Clear Passages.

586
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,337
What?

587
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:06,705
It's he herbal colonic

588
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:08,007
and weed shop on Crestview.

589
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,275
I own 20%.

590
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:10,576
That is so disturbing.

591
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:13,928
Have you ever seen the
contents of a lower colon?

592
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:14,779
Oh, geez...

593
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,314
Stop!

594
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:17,983
And you tried to take 'em out?!

595
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:19,919
They boxed
us in, Luteniant.

596
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:21,563
I clipped one of 'em trying
to stay with Morrow.

597
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:23,056
Were they driving
the speed limit?

598
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:24,624
Maybe, at first,
but then they took off.

599
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,827
Must've been doing 110
on 18. It was crazy.

600
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:27,862
No shit.

601
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:29,030
These guys are smart.

602
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:30,665
They'll claim that you tried to

603
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,868
kill 'em, that they were
fleeing out of fear.

604
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:35,905
Then they'll try to sue us
for assault!

605
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:37,306
Just cut 'em loose.

606
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,509
And the next time you try to
play GTA on my watch,

607
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:43,244
I'm gonna bounce you
back to park duty!

608
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:44,879
Yes, sir.

609
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,061
Just heard from Worski.

610
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,330
Sons are meeting at the
warehouse tonight,

611
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:06,200
checking out the
Russian operation.

612
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:09,070
MC's not wasting any time.

613
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:11,605
Should I put a team
nearby, wire it up?

614
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:14,208
No, let's not risk it.

615
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:16,553
Sounds like it's just
a show and tell.

616
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:19,513
Let them all get friendly.

617
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:21,515
One big happy family.

618
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,075
The boys are napping.

619
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:58,954
Jax, stop!

620
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:29,521
I missed you so much.

621
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:34,693
Love me.

622
00:32:43,204 --> 00:32:46,306
Damn, that was fast.

623
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:49,500
Yeah, that's 'cause
you're used to

624
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,312
speed-banging Juice
in dark hallways.

625
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:56,049
Hey, don't turn what
Juice and I had into

626
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:57,751
into something cheap and tawdry!

627
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:02,321
I'm sure it was sweet
Puerto Rican magic.

628
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,266
No more time, baby.

629
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:18,035
I don't think I can handle it.

630
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:22,606
Yeah, I know.

631
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:27,500
We're gonna be
all right, darling.

632
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,651
The Russians?

633
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,354
Handled.

634
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:42,360
These new guns gonna be our

635
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,996
golden ticket, Gem.

636
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,200
My finder's fee, my
new percentage...

637
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,571
I should bank around seven
figures before I'm done.

638
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,777
We are gonna be okay, baby.

639
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:01,479
No more killing ourselves.

640
00:34:01,548 --> 00:34:03,147
I promise.

641
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:14,726
How bad are they?

642
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:22,693
The meds they gave me
inside didn't do very much.

643
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:27,936
I mean, it's all right on a day
like this when it's warm but...

644
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:34,528
I don't know how many
winters I got left.

645
00:34:34,597 --> 00:34:40,935
One, two at the most.

646
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,304
There's plenty we can do.

647
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:47,042
I have Tara looking
into a good surgeon.

648
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:50,915
No, I ain't lettin'
nobody cut me open.

649
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:54,526
I'd have to step down to recoup.

650
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,422
Don't make any sense.

651
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,923
Well, we'll just,

652
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:01,124
we'll get better meds,

653
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:03,393
keep doing the cortisone.

654
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:05,929
You got plenty of time, baby.

655
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,933
Yeah.

656
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:20,043
I went to see Unser.

657
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,482
You gotta go out there, Clay.

658
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,217
He needs you.

659
00:35:27,286 --> 00:35:29,787
He needs this club.

660
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:38,996
What he did for us...

661
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:41,966
Stahl.

662
00:35:42,035 --> 00:35:44,302
Yeah, I know.

663
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,358
I know.

664
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:09,580
I think we should talk
about some things, Jax.

665
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:15,058
Yeah, we should talk
about all the chick shit

666
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:18,094
you decked out my house in.

667
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:21,256
I'm sorry, Maxim posters and

668
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:25,868
Harley mirrors aren't
really my style.

669
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:34,244
I want to talk about
the boys, Jax.

670
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:37,548
About what we're gonna do.

671
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:49,660
Sounds like someone else
wants a shot at those puppies.

672
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,762
Oh!

673
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,401
I'll get him.

674
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:07,043
Hey, you're supposed
to be gone by now.

675
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:09,513
<i>It's bad luck to see the bride.</i>

676
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:12,950
Just getting my stuff.

677
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:13,884
Figured I'd wear my

678
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:16,421
clean socks on the big day.

679
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,091
Wow, I'm honored.

680
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:25,532
You sure you want to do this?

681
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:28,702
It's kinda late to
back out now.

682
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:34,874
It's never too late to run.

683
00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:44,617
I'm not running.

684
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:47,186
I'm not going away.

685
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:50,523
Like it or not, I'm part
of this family.

686
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:53,927
I like it.

687
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:57,732
And I'm happy that we're

688
00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:59,867
going to be adding to it.

689
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:13,282
Hey, hey...

690
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:15,184
Look.

691
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:16,685
What is this?

692
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,988
All right, huh?

693
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:20,422
Come on.

694
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:23,425
There you go.

695
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:36,937
Here's Mommy.

696
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,241
Hey, hi, sweetie.

697
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,709
Hey, baby.

698
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,178
Hi.

699
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:47,014
Want to lie down?

700
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:48,615
Here you go.

701
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,589
Oh, my God!

702
00:38:57,693 --> 00:38:59,928
It's beautiful.

703
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,738
Are you...?

704
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:13,075
Yeah.

705
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,112
We should get married.

706
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:18,882
Really?

707
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,784
I mean, you want... that?

708
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:24,955
I love you, Tara.

709
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:28,358
I've loved you since I was 16.

710
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:29,993
You stayed when anyone

711
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:31,495
else would've bailed.

712
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,215
You've given me a
beautiful son...

713
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,566
taken Abel on as your own.

714
00:39:43,274 --> 00:39:46,410
I love you, too.

715
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:48,178
So much.

716
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:53,884
And I... I want all of that...

717
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:57,621
But...

718
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,358
I just...

719
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:04,962
I know this is who
you are, Jax and I...

720
00:40:05,031 --> 00:40:08,800
I would never try to change
that-- the club, Charming.

721
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:13,705
I've learned so many things
while you were away.

722
00:40:13,774 --> 00:40:15,641
So have I.

723
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,676
And I look at Thomas

724
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:19,812
and Abel, and I...

725
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:22,982
I think, how does this work?

726
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,050
How...

727
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,454
How do they grow up in this?

728
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:30,757
- Yes.
- I know.

729
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:32,959
And they're not going to.

730
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:36,962
What do you mean?

731
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:40,466
I realized you being with me
it's not some kind of accident.

732
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:47,338
It sounds crazy, but I think you were
put into my life to get me out, Tara

733
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:48,973
15 years ago.

734
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:53,211
And now.

735
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,082
I'm done with SAMCRO.

736
00:40:57,151 --> 00:41:00,486
We both know, if I stay, I end
up back in prison or dead.

737
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:02,488
You say that now
because you just got out.

738
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:07,160
No. I've been coming
to this for a while.

739
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:09,329
The bond that holds this club
together isn't about love or

740
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:11,558
brotherhood anymore.

741
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:17,236
We lost that a long time ago.

742
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:22,173
It's just fear and greed now.

743
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:26,644
That's what your father
said in his manuscript.

744
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:29,647
Yeah.

745
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:37,656
He wanted to get out.

746
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:41,660
JT was a coward.

747
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:43,763
He lost himself in Irish pussy

748
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:46,266
and bailed on his family.

749
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:50,203
Instead of writing about it,
he should've done something.

750
00:41:50,272 --> 00:41:51,638
He should've taken me and Thomas

751
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:53,640
and gotten the hell
out of Charming.

752
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,641
Hm, well, he would've had
to go through Gemma first.

753
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,500
Then he should've run
her ass over.

754
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,214
I'm not my father.

755
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:05,217
I'm not weak.

756
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,388
How do you get out?

757
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:12,924
Clay and Gemma will never let

758
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:17,929
you just leave.

759
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:21,900
We got a good thing
going with the Irish now.

760
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:27,806
It's smart, under the radar.

761
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,825
We'll be making big
money this year.

762
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:32,721
I just gotta hang out for a
while and earn.

763
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:35,881
How long?

764
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,418
More guns means more risk.

765
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,900
I don't have any skills, Tara.

766
00:42:43,558 --> 00:42:45,692
I'm an okay mechanic with a GED.

767
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
The only thing I ever
did well was outlaw.

768
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,198
I just need to make some bank,

769
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:53,899
set myself up with something...

770
00:42:53,968 --> 00:42:56,035
Jax, I can go anywhere.

771
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:57,800
I make good money.

772
00:42:59,107 --> 00:43:01,761
I'm not gonna live off my wife.

773
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:05,812
I can't.

774
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:11,617
Look.

775
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:14,186
Clay's hands are going;

776
00:43:14,255 --> 00:43:16,922
His days are numbered.

777
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:18,597
When he steps down,
he loses sway,

778
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:20,000
that's when I get out.

779
00:43:23,097 --> 00:43:26,899
And Gemma...

780
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:29,902
she's just an old lady.

781
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:34,640
All this scares me.

782
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:37,043
I know. Hey.

783
00:43:37,111 --> 00:43:38,544
You gotta trust me.

784
00:43:38,613 --> 00:43:40,366
This is all I have
been thinking about

785
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,500
for the last 14 months.

786
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:45,560
I'm gonna finish up with SAMCRO,

787
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,119
then we're gonna take our boys

788
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,890
and we're gonna get
the hell out of here.

789
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:53,126
Start fresh somewhere.

790
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:56,462
Be a real family.

791
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:24,105
Hey.

792
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:25,640
What the hell you doing here?

793
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:26,642
Ah, I got a call.

794
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:29,511
Jed Clampett wants his
front yard back.

795
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,979
What?

796
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:33,381
It's my new style.

797
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,450
Retro redneck.

798
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:38,019
Good to see you.

799
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:40,221
Good to see you, too.

800
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,557
I'm, um... I'm sorry

801
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,659
I missed your homecoming.

802
00:44:44,728 --> 00:44:48,831
Aw, that's all right.

803
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,367
I got some beer in the fridge.

804
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:54,370
I'm good.

805
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:07,116
I heard you sold the business.

806
00:45:07,185 --> 00:45:08,752
Uh...

807
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,587
Controlling interest.

808
00:45:10,656 --> 00:45:12,689
Still get a check every month.

809
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:15,658
Enough to keep me in the, uh,

810
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:17,961
lifestyle I'm accustomed to.

811
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:19,600
I see that.

812
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:24,822
Assume you're caught
up on the growth

813
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:26,570
and prosperity
of our little burg?

814
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:29,239
I saw it... riding in.

815
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:31,808
Also met Wild Black Hickok.

816
00:45:31,877 --> 00:45:34,744
He, uh, provided me with the

817
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:39,483
interracial shadow.

818
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:42,886
Town's upside down, Wayne.

819
00:45:42,955 --> 00:45:44,622
I know.

820
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,800
I'm not sure which
cancer's worse.

821
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:50,362
The one in me, or the
one in Charming.

822
00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:51,928
Well...

823
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:56,267
You rotting away out here,
it ain't helpin' either one.

824
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:59,035
It don't hurt as much,

825
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:01,404
being unplugged.

826
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:03,739
Well, you're gonna have
to plug yourself back in, pal,

827
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:09,178
'cause... I need you.

828
00:46:09,247 --> 00:46:13,349
I ain't gonna let Hale win.

829
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:18,051
There ain't gonna be no
Charming Heights.

830
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:26,330
How you gonna stop it?

831
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:30,301
Make nature take its course.

832
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,470
I got no idea what

833
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,374
the hell that means.

834
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:36,976
Other than it involves a lot of

835
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,000

Still got access to
the rental trucks?

838
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,443
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna need one tonight.

839
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:50,789
Like, uh... catering trucks.

840

see around a wedding.

841

What's it for?

842

848
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,661
How are the wrists?

849
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,697
A little sore.

850
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,600

we come together today
under the all-seeing eye

863

What?

885
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,915
With this ring, I vow

886

my love.

887
00:50:33,986 --> 00:50:35,985

my love.

892
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:53,804
And I promise always to cherish

893
00:50:53,873 --> 00:50:55,807
and protect you.

894
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,976
What else?

895
00:51:00,045 --> 00:51:01,979
And treat you as good

896
00:51:02,048 --> 00:51:04,382
as my leather and...

897
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:07,852
Ride you as much as my Harley.

898
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:09,019
(all cheering, whooping,

899
00:51:09,088 --> 00:51:12,022
applauding and laughing)

900
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:17,600
By the power
invested in me by the laws of

901
00:51:17,662 --> 00:51:19,763
the Wahewa and the State of

902
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:21,932
California, I pronounce you

903
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:23,266
man and wife.

904

Have at it.

905
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:17,600
You get a hint of a
tale, you abort.

906
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:19,042
Yes, Mom.

907
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:21,044
Drink heavily for us.

908
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,724
Appreciate you giving

909
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:35,559
brown the nod inside.

910
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:37,561
Kept us alive while we figured

911
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,062
out our Russian problem.

912
00:52:39,131 --> 00:52:41,325
Just protecting my interests.

913
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:45,136
Talked to our man yesterday.

914
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,604
All set up for tomorrow.

915
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:49,273
He should probably get

916
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:51,075
there first.

917
00:52:51,144 --> 00:52:54,511
We got the local law
keeping tabs.

918
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,185
We should be safe
once we're inside.

919
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:01,052
I'll let him know.

920
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:04,656
Hey.

921
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,257
Let's dance.

922
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,829
Okay.

923
00:53:25,278 --> 00:53:27,365
They call it the "Cop Killer".

924
00:53:28,181 --> 00:53:30,148
It cuts through Kevlar and body

925
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:32,017
armor like soft cheese.

926
00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:34,786
Very little kick.

927
00:53:36,522 --> 00:53:38,610
The best wedding gift, ever.

928
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:39,800
Wait till you see Juice's gift.

929
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,537
You're gonna want to use
that on yourself.

930
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,533
New hand cannon.

931
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,302
Thank you.

932
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,044
And this next song is
a bride request.

933
00:53:53,474 --> 00:53:55,448
Oh, I'm gonna want to
play with this.

934

Wow!
